Spline 3D tutorial with React

I found this Yt tutorial for Spline. Spline is a design tool for 3d web experience. Tutorial was very good
regarding introduction into spline, but where it lacked was in the web integration part. Tutorial introduced
web part in code sandbox, which I have nothing against, but closely following project and typing everything
correctly and later copying everything, you encounter weird error. Overflow-x; when given hidden option, hides whole wrapper!
I mean, it's not that hard an error/problem to fix, but it's still there. Project works in sandbox, but in Visual Studio Code,
in local host, it's kinda not.

My experience of Spline is that, it's kinda hard to use it in modern web development. And I don't mean it in, learning sense,
but in browsers incompatiblity sense. Some browsers are faster, others are slower, which will affect user experience when using 
your site. Will try to make simpler 3D objects and implement them into Portfolio project and see if it is feasible to use it that way.

Anyway, need to learn how to use Figma properly and I will start Portfolio Project with Spline.
See ya in next project!
